HAVE MEYER'S CROEVER
The village of Croev, a wine growing
center on the Moselle River, produces
such excellent wines that, in the middle
ages, even children were fond of
it.
They tried to get it wherever they could.
The city council decided to do something
to stop this Juvenile Delinquency" and
since the boys operated a
night, the
Council appointed a night watchman
As soon as the watchman caught
somebody tapping a barrel he yelled
Nacktarsch
Nacktarsch
and woke
up the citizenry to give the boys a
spanking. The label is the consequence
of that story and to this day a famous
wine has retained its original name:
