The 14 vineyards of the TRAPICHE Estates total more than 4,000 acres,
each with its own distinct micro-climate. These rich vineyards are at
the base of the majestic Argentine Andes in the province of Mendoza.
Chardonnay, the regal grape of Burgundy, flourishes in Tupungato,
3300 feet above sea level, in an alluvial soil with excellent drainage.
The outstanding fruit of this vintage was harvested and vinified in late
February. Then as the French do
we rested the wine on the
"Lees" for sixty days to add complexity of flavor and bouquet.
