The 14 vineyards of the TRAPICHE Estates total more than 4,000 acres,
each with its own distinct micro-climate. These rich vineyards are at
the base of the majestic Argentine Andes in the province of Mendoza.
At our Vistalba Vineyard, we have the ideal ambiance for this difficult
variety; high altitude, cold winters, cool nights and a pebbled sub-soil
with excellent drainage. We vinify in early March, "cooling the must"
during fermentation. The result a fruity, low tannin, light bodied wine
with an identifiable Pinot Noir character.
