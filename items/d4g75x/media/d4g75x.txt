The 14 vineyards of the TRAPICHE Estates total more than 4,000 acres,
each with its own distinct micro-climate. These rich vineyards are at
the base of the majestic Argentine Andes in the province of Mendoza.
Our Las Palmas Vineyard's 220 acres, at Cruz de Piedra, Maipu, ele-
vated at 3200 feet, provided us with excellent fruit. We harvested the
lush grapes in February and vinified to medium body, pronounced bou-
quet and brilliant ruby color. This vintage was aged an average of 24
months in French 0ak, with further bottle improvement from the time of
bottling to its release.
