THE HARDY COLLECTION
JIMMY WATSON TROPHY WINNER
1987 PADTHAMAY CABERNETSAUVIGNON
WINEMAKER: DAVID O'LEARY
ARTIST: ARTHUR BOYD
Fine art and wine have been synonymous for centuries and Hardy's
as patrons of Australian art, have created the Hardy Collection series
of fine varietal wines. To add to the character and personality of
each individual wine in the series, we have used original paintings
permanently displayed at our Homestead at Reynella.
This wine epitomises the success of the Hardy Collection range of
wines since their launch in 1985. The Jimmy Watson Trophy is
awarded annually at the Melbourne Wine Show and is considered to
be Australia's top red wine prize. This wine is a fine example of
Australia's most elegant Cabernet Sauvignon for the 1987 vintage
This wine shows an intense varietal character and a bouquet of spicy
Cabernet aromas. The wine is well balanced with fruit and oak and
shows berry flavours on the palate followed by a firm
tannin finish.
t is a marvellous drinking wine now and has the potential to
develop further through a period of cellaring.
We are indeed proud to present this 1988 Jimmy Watson Trophy
wine from the Hardy Collection. Cheers
