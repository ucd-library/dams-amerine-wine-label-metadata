The Trapiche estates are situated in Mendoza province. Their
unique position,at a height of 3,000 feet at the base of the majestic
snow-capped Argentine Andes provides a perfect micro-climate
that enables Trapiche to extract the very best out of classic varie-
tals, notably, Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay.The excellent
Malbec also thrives in these conditions.
The vintage is harvested in February and the wines are matured in
new French oak barrigues for several months, followed by further
ageing in bottle. This combination of prime site, excellent fruit and
classic production methods ensures that Trapiche's oak aged wines
are of the highest quality
