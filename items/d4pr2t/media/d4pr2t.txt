The Trapiche estates are situated in Mendoza province. Their
unique position,at a height of 3,000 feet at the base of the majestic
snow-capped Argentine Andes provides a perfect micro-climate
that enables Trapiche to extract the very best out of classic varie-
tals, notably, Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. The excellent
Malbec also thrives in these conditions
The vintage is harvested in February and the wines are matured in
new French oak barriques for several months, followed by further
ageing in bottle. This combination of prime site, excellent fruit and

are of the highest quality
